1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
	
HTTP1.1
Year-1997

Key Features - It supports connection reuse  for every TCP connection

Status Code - Introduces a warning header field to carry additional information about the status of a message. Can define 24 status codes  error reporting is quicker and more efficient

Authentication Mechanism - It is relatively secure since it uses digest authentication NTLM authentication.

Caching - Expands on the caching support by using additional headers like cache-control conditional headers like If-Match and by using entity tags

Web Traffic - HTTP/1.1 provides faster delivery of web pages and reduces web traffic 

HTTP2
Year-2015

Key Features - Uses multiplexing where over a single TCP connection

Status Code   - Underlying semantics of HTTP such as headers status codes remains the same.

Authentication Mechanism - Security concerns from previous versions will continue to be seen in HTTP/2 . it is better equipped to deal with them due to new TLS features like connection error of type Inadequate_Security.

Caching - HTTP/2 does not change much in terms of caching.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web Traffic - HTTP/2 utilizes multiplexing and server push to effectively reduce the page load time
2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

 Objects are important data types in javascript. 
Objects are different then primitive data types (number, string, boolean, etc.). Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in the form of Key: value pair. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods respectively, in the context of an object.
Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.
var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Rolls Royce';
myCar.model = 'Ghost';
myCar.year = 2009;
myCar.wheels = 4;
After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.
myCar.year
Output: 2009
